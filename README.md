**This repo contains internal documentation for all Ocean engineering processes. You will find most of the key documents on our [central documentation site](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com) under Core Concepts.**

See [Ocean project map](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/engineering/blob/master/PROJECT_MAP.md) for current development status and handy links.

The main objective of the Ocean Engineering practice is:

* Simplify what we do in order to avoid reinventing the wheel.
* Promote quality and security.
* Better communication about what we do and why we are doing it. Our community needs information!
* Be more effective in order to make a better use of our time.
* Use some common good principles & patterns. These can be useful!

The engineering practice is based in a list of key [principles](doc/principles.md) based in the **CAMS** acronym (Culture, Automation, Measurement and Sharing).

## Key Concepts

- **Simplicity** - Everything we define should be thin and simple.
- **Open Source** - We are building FLOSS, so Open Source and Open Standards.
- **Openness** - Community first, open discussions, open documentation, open requirements.
- **Quality** - New best practices should be oriented to promote a high quality product.
- **Security** - Security MUST be a first class citizen.
- **Automation** - We should automate as much as we can...it will make our lives easier.
- **Team** - All of us are part of the team. All the best practices will be defined by all us.

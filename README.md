The main objective of the Ocean Engineering practice is:

* Simplify what we do, we should avoid reinventing the wheel.
* Promote the quality and security.
* Communicate better what we do and why we are doing it. Our community needs information.
* Be more effective, make a better use of our time.
* Use some common good principles & patterns. Some of those can be useful.

The engineering practice is based in a list of key [principles](doc/principles.md) based in the **CAMS** acronym (Culture, Automation, Measurement and Sharing).

## Key Concepts

- **Simplicity** - All what we define should be thin and simple.
- **Open Source** - We are building FLOSS, so Open Source and Open Standards.
- **Openness** - Community first, open discussions, open documentation, open requirements.
- **Quality** - New practices should be oriented to promote a high quality product.
- **Security** - Same than previous point. Security is a first class citizen.
- **Automation** - We should automate as much as we can, it will make our lifeâ€™s easier.
- **Team** - All of us are part of the team. All the good practices will be defined by all us.

## Areas

The documentation is divided in different areas:

- [Development](doc/development.md)
- [DevOps](doc/devops.md)
- [QA](doc/qa.md)
- [Security](doc/security.md)
- [Architecture](doc/architecture.md)
- [Lifecycle](doc/alm.md)

## Contributing

We use GitHub as a means for maintaining and tracking issues and source code development.

If you would like to contribute, please fork this repository, do work in a feature branch, and finally open a pull request for maintainers to review your changes.

Ocean Protocol uses [C4 Standard process](https://github.com/unprotocols/rfc/blob/master/1/README.md) to manage changes in the source code.  Find here more details about [Ocean C4 OEP](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/OEPs/tree/master/1).

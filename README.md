The main objective of the Ocean Engineering practice is:

* Simplify what we do, we should avoid reinventing the wheel.
* Promote the quality and security.
* Communicate better what we do and why we are doing it. Our community needs information.
* Be more effective, make a better use of our time.
* Use some common good principles & patterns. Some of those can be useful.


The engineering documentation is divided in 5 different sections:

- [Development](doc/development.md)
- [DevOps](doc/devops.md)
- [QA](doc/qa.md)
- [Security](doc/security.md)
- [Architecture](doc/architecture.md)

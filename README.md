**This repo contains internal documentation for all Ocean engineering processes.**

The Ocean Engineering practice follows a list of  [key principles](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/principles/) based on the **CAMS** acronym (Culture, Automation, Measurement and Sharing).

See the [Ocean project map](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/engineering/blob/master/PROJECT_MAP.md) for current development status and handy links.

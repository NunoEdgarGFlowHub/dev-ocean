# Ocean Engineering Principles

Our engineering principles are based in the DevOps **CAMS** acronym (Culture, Automation, Measurement and Sharing).

## Culture

The backbone to any organization is its culture. It can be considered the “way of life” of an organization.
The Engineering practice it's about more than acquiring new tools and taking on new practices. It’s about setting expectations and priorities, and the fundamental beliefs that guide them.
Key elements of this are:

| Belief                    | Description |
|:--------------------------|:------------|
| Learn to trust            | It is necessary to have a unified agreement and understanding that we are all on the same team.
| Understand motivations    | Conflict often occurs when people don’t understand each other and their motivation. Having common objectives and an understanding about the motivations of others helps achieve common goals.
| Eliminate blame           | Blame is pointless. In problematic situations it’s necessary to understand what went wrong and how to make sure it doesn’t happen again
| Anticipate the failure    | Constant learning from mistakes and previous failures. Previous problems should be used to learn and provide the mechanisms to anticipate the failure
| Focus on bottlenecks and flow | Rethinking the process and refactor constantly. Simple is better.
| Eliminate unplanned work  | Unplanned work is common but is important to understand that priorities should be taken into consideration. It means some lower priority issues may need to go on hold.
| Be continuous             | Iterating in releases cycles at a constant pace. It provides a continuous flow of deliverables adding business value.
| Form dedicated, cross-functional teams | Arranging people around projects, rather than grouping them based off their skill sets
| Transparency              | Transparency improves efficiency and productivity, reduces time and boosts employees' engagement
| Build autonomy, mastery and purpose | It’s necessary to create a working environment where people feel they have autonomy, mastery and purpose. Rewarding people and review the goals, ensuring the there is a clear single goal everyone can focus on.


## Automation

Automation embraces every aspect of the software and systems lifecycle, including requirements gathering, design, development, testing, application deployment and operations support.

| Benefit                   | Description |
|:--------------------------|:------------|
| Faster time to market     | Quick application deployments and easy communication to the different stakeholders make getting to market faster
| Continuous Integration    | People can easily do unit testing, code quality analysis, and then commit to the SCM for build from an IDE, all in an integrated tool setup without switching between the systems
| Continuous Delivery       | Teams can generate automatically releases ready to be installed in any environment


## Measurement

If you can’t measure, you can’t improve. A successful Engineering & DevOps implementation will measure everything it can as often as it can.

| Benefit                   | Description |
|:--------------------------|:------------|
| Performance               | Depending of the application it involves gathering the key performance indicators. Those are useful to understand the status and define proactive actions improving the applications stability and performance
| Process                   | Reviewing the process performance to understand if the processes should be refactored.
| People                    | It involves the reviewing team member personal metrics to understand the personal performance. Some could require support and they are not communicating it. Understanding the situation can make easier to help others


## Sharing

Today’s organizations and software require teams of people with different skills and specialized knowledge.
To work efficiently, it’s important to work well together, and sharing is how you get there.


| Belief                    | Description |
|:--------------------------|:------------|
| Open Communication        | Open, honest and clear communication helps to share the information. Internal and External communication, top-bottom and bottom-top.
| Shared knowledge          | Successful teams share their experiences, knowledge should be shared and spread across the people
| Information accessible    | Expose metrics to everyone within your organization who might be interested. Keep things simple and clear — explain how these metrics affect software delivery and overall company performance. Sharing progress data will also help foster a more effective culture.

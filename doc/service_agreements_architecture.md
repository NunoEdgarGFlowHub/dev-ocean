# Smart Service Level Agreement

This document provides technical details and describes the design of service agreements 
in ocean protocol.


## Definition

### Service

Service agreement is a commitment between provider/s and consumer of a service. In this commitment, the provider and 
consumer agree on quality, availability, and responsibilities involved in the service.

### Condition

A service provider defines one or more SLAs that apply to their services. Any defined  service 
between parties may/not be associated with a set of conditions
 and `asset/s`. In Ocean Protocol, a SLA is expressed as a set of `conditions` with 
 dependencies where any condition is defined as follows:

- Control Smart Contract Address: This defines the business logic concerning one or more conditions
in the service agreement. This applies [Storage-Control Pattern](#storage-control-pattern)
- Function Fingerprint: For each condition in the control smart contract, there is a function 
fulfills only one condition
- Dependency Conditions (*Optional*): enforces the execution of the dependency model for this condition 
in terms of list of condition/s that must be fulfilled. The dependency model is defined in terms of tree structure 
in order to avoid any circular dependency and satisfy the `termination` and `correctness` of the model as shown below:

## Components

### Conditions

In Ocean Protocol, Condition has two representations. The first representation defines 
the `event` and the associated `action` where stakeholders (consumers, tribes, marketplaces, 
data scientists, etc.) store it ( in terms of json object) `off-chain`. 
This will enable parties to track the progress of the service agreement. This model is defined as 
[event-action model](#event-action-representation). The second representation is a compressed version of 
the json object and stored `on-chain`. This compressed version holds only the minimal required information 
in order to fulfill a condition in the service agreement.

#### Event-Action Representation

The below json shows how the service parties interact based on [Trigger-Event-Action](#event-action-pattern) pattern which 
represents the core orchestration pattern in Ocean Service Agreement. 

```json
{
  "serviceAgreementId":{
    "version":"0.1",
    "conditionName":{ 
        "controlContract":{
          "address":"0x123456789abcdef",
          "function":"<Function FingerPrint>",
          "description":"SHOW THIS DESCRIPTION IN FRONTEND"
        },
        "events":{
            "eventName":[
              {
                "action":"callback function", // the coressponding action 
                "parameters":{ // mapping parameters from event to action [optional]
                  "event.x": "x",
                  "event.y": "y"
                }
              }
            ]
        },
        "dependency":[{
          "dependencyConditionName": true  // dependency condition status
        }]
    }
  }
}
```
The emitted events are generated by the control/logic smart contract (conditions) and handled by the parties that are associated to this event. Each event 
trigger one or more action/s. These actions are defined by the service agreement provider. As a result this will 
give any entity (tribe, organization, consortium, or marketplace) the `optionality` to define there own internal actions 
and integrate their off-chain services using the same way.

### Event-Action Pattern

The event-action pattern is close to [Event-driven Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture). It 
is specified as model to represents the interaction between parties. As shown in the below figure:

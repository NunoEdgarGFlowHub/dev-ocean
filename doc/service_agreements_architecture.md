This document describes the design of service agreements in ocean protocol and provides an implementation guide.


### Definition
Service agreement is a commitment between provider and consumer of a service. In this commitment, the provider and 
consumer agree on quality, availability, and responsibilities involved in the service.

A service provider defines one or more SLAs that apply to their services.
In Ocean Protocol, an SLA is expressed as a set of `conditions` with dependencies

# Service Agreements in Ocean Protocol

Ocean Protocol is a network enabling discovery and trust between service (data and related services) providers and consumers. To enable delivery and payment for these services, we need pre-signed agreements between the providers and consumers. These service agreements can greatly help with setting expectations and defining terms of delivery in a permission-less network.

## Services

On a high-level, the services published and provided as part of a marketplace based on Ocean Protocol are,

1. Data (data sets)
1. Algorithms
1. Compute
1. Storage
1. Verification of compute
1. Combination of some of the above

## Service Agreements

For providing and consuming the services defined above, a service agreement should define the following elements,

1. Service provider(s) and consumer - The agreement should identify the involved parties in the service delivery.
1. Scope of delivery - The service agreement should clearly define what services are to be provided.
1. Conditions of delivery - The service agreement should also define the conditions of delivery of services. These conditions should be proposed by the provider and should be agreed on by the consumer.
1. Verification (optional)- If needed, a service agreement should define the conditions and scenarios for verification of delivery of service.
1. Disputes and settlement - A service agreement should define a process for handling disputes between the service provider and consumer. The dispute resolution can be on-chain (verification and/or voting) or off-chain (third party arbitration).
1. Payment - The service agreement should also provide the terms and conditions of payment from the consumer to the provider.

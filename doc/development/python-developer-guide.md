## Publishing libraries to PyPI

The purpose of this section is provide a guide to follow when you want to configure a Python project and deployed to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).  

### PyPI
The Python Package Index (PyPI) stores meta-data describing distributions packaged with distutils, as well as package data like distribution files if a package author wishes.
Once your package (and its associate meta-data) has been uploaded to PyPI, others can download and install it using pip.
Pypi is going to take the meta-data from your setup.py file.

If this is the first time this particular package is being uploaded to PyPI, you'll first need to register it:

```
python setup.py register
```
Next times the package is going to be uploaded when you create a new release in github automatically.


### Project organization
To get a better sense of how your files should be organized, here's a simplified structure of a Python project:  

```
name-of-your-project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ imgs
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ doc.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ name_of_your_project
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ code.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_code.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .travis.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HISTORY.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements_dev.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.cfg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tox.ini
```

### Setup.py
Is the file that tells a distribution tool, such as Distutils or Setuptools, how to install and configure the package.  
Here you have an example of how an Ocean setup.py file looks like:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

"""The setup script."""

from setuptools import setup, find_packages

with open('README.md') as readme_file:
    readme = readme_file.read()

with open('HISTORY.md') as history_file:
    history = history_file.read()

requirements = [YOUR_REQUIREMENTS]

setup_requirements = ['pytest-runner', ]

test_requirements = ['pytest', ]

setup(
    author="leucothia",
    author_email='devops@oceanprotocol.com',
    classifiers=[
        'Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha',
        'Intended Audience :: Developers',
        'License :: OSI Approved :: Apache Software License',
        'Natural Language :: English',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.4',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.5',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6',
    ],
    description=" üê≥ DESCRIPTION_OF_YOUR_PACKAGE",
    install_requires=requirements,
    license="Apache Software License 2.0",
    long_description=readme + + '\n\n' + history,
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
    include_package_data=True,
    keywords='REPO_NAME',
    name='REPO_NAME',
    packages=find_packages(include=['YOUR_PACKAGES']),
    setup_requires=setup_requirements,
    test_suite='tests',
    tests_require=test_requirements,
    url='https://github.com/oceanprotocol/REPO_NAME',
    version='0.0.1',
    zip_safe=False,
)

```

## Logging

Python `logging` should be employed generously. In the root calling
script, import the logging module and configure to the desired syntax and
handling;
```
from package_dir.log import setup_logging
import logging
setup_logging()
```

Where `setup_logging()` imports and applies the logging configuration from
a YAML configuration if specified, otherwise it defaults to `logging.basicConfig`.

Logging uses the `coloredlogs` package.

An example configuration file is presented below as a starting point;

Example 1) Simple logging to console;
```
version: 1

disable_existing_loggers: False
formatters:
    simple:
        format: "%(name)-5s - %(levelno)-3s - %(module)-20s  %(funcName)-30s: %(message)s"

handlers:
    console:
        class: logging.StreamHandler
        level: DEBUG
        formatter: simple
        stream: ext://sys.stdout

loggers:
    my_module:
        level: ERROR
        handlers: [console]
        propagate: no

root:
    level: DEBUG
    handlers: [console]
```

Note that the Python logging module organizes loggers in a hierarchy, all
loggers are descendants of root.


Example 2) A more complex example, with files and file size limits;

TODO: Update this section with the actual config used throughout Ocean

```yaml
version: 1
disable_existing_loggers: False
formatters:
    simple:
        format: "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"

handlers:
    console:
        class: logging.StreamHandler
        level: DEBUG
        formatter: simple
        stream: ext://sys.stdout

    info_file_handler:
        class: logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler
        level: INFO
        formatter: simple
        filename: info.log
        maxBytes: 10485760 # 10MB
        backupCount: 20
        encoding: utf8

    error_file_handler:
        class: logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler
        level: ERROR
        formatter: simple
        filename: errors.log
        maxBytes: 10485760 # 10MB
        backupCount: 20
        encoding: utf8

loggers:
    my_module:
        level: ERROR
        handlers: [console] # Ignore the file handlers until deployment
        propagate: no

root:
    level: INFO
    handlers: [console, info_file_handler, error_file_handler]
```

## Testing

### Tox
Tox is a tool that provides "standardized testing in Python",and it goes beyond merely running your tests with more than one version of the interpreter. It creates a fully sandboxed environment in which your package and its requirements are installed and tested. If you made a change that works fine when tested directly but the change inadvertently broke your installation, you'll discover that with tox.

## Continuous Integration

### Travis CI
TravisCI is a service that makes continuous integration for GitHub projects  easy. You need to create one simple file:


```
language: python
python:
  - 3.6
  - 3.5
  - 3.4

# Command to install dependencies, e.g. pip install -r requirements.txt --use-mirrors
install: pip install -U tox-travis
script: tox
deploy:
  provider: pypi
  distributions: sdist bdist_wheel
  user: leucothia
  password:
    secure: LEUCOTHIA_PASSWORD_ENCRYPTED
  on:
    tags: true
    branch: master
    repo: oceanprotocol/REPO_NAME
    python: 3.6

```

In order to generate the secure password, you have to run the following command in your project directory:

```
echo -n LEUCOTHIA_PASSWORD | travis encrypt --add deploy.password -r oceanprotocol/REPO_NAME
```

### Bumpversion

Related with the travis CI we are going to integrate Bumpversion to allow as 
to automatically point to the new version when we create a new realese.
[bumpversion](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion)

### Testing within PyCharm

Create a testing run configuation using PyTest

Ensure correct target script and interpreter

Add the `--log-cli-level info` (or other logging level) argument to the run configuration, to post logging messages into the console.

## Local package management and virtual environments

### Anaconda
For handling packages and environments. Includes the python version in the environment.

Can use `conda` with `pip` if a package is not on the main channel, but check
[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge) as well, many packages have been
migrated by the community.

**BEWARE** of pip installation in Conda! pip may report `Successfully installed`, but if there are any errors, the packages are not installed in the conda environment. Resolve all errors until `pip install -r requirements.txt` succeeds. 

To work with conda environments, use the `conda env` command i.e.;
`conda env list` to list all environments on the machine
`conda env create --name myname --file environment.yml` to create a new env from .yml
`conda env update --file environment.yml` to update an existing env from .yml


#### Create environment file
Conda uses a YAML file to specify environment dependencies, similar to pip `requirements.txt`.

```
name: test23
dependencies:
  - python=3.6
  - pip:
    - pip
    - bumpversion
    - wheel
    - watchdog
    - flake8
    - tox
    - coverage
    - keeper-contracts
    - singletonify
    - twine
    - setuptools
    - py-solc
    - web3
    - PyJWT
    - pyopenssl
    - eciespy
    - codacy-coverage
    - pytest
    - pytest-runner
```

TODO: Add and describe the channels: section

Generally, you can install from the yaml file as follows; 

`conda env create --name ocean-web3 --file environment.yml`

To integrate this environment in PyCharm;
1. Create the environment on the command line (no proper support in PyCharm yet)
1. In PyCharm; Settings / Project: Name / Project Interpreter
1. Add / Conda
1. Existing Environment, select from the auto-generated drop down list

### pyenv

### pipenv
The new kid on the block. [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) on GitHub.

## IDE's and editors
### Jupyter Lab
`pip install ipykernel` in each environment to get kernel switching working!

### Atom

### Spyder
Install Spyder in each venv to ensure the kernel is used. 

### Eclipse + PyDev

### PyCharm

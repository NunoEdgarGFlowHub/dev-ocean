## Package management and virtual environments
### Anaconda
Prefer for handling packages and environments. More capable than pip + virtualenv.

Can use `conda` with `pip` if a package is not on the main channel, but check
[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge) as well, many packages have been
migrated by the community.

### pyenv

### pipenv
The new kid on the block. [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) on GitHub.

## IDE's and editors
### Jupyter Lab
`pip install ipykernel` in each environment to get kernel switching working!

### Atom


### Spyder
Install Spyder in each venv to ensure the kernel is used. 

### Eclipse + PyDev

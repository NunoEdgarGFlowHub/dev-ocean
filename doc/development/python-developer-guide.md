# Python Developer Guide
*DRAFT FOR CONSIDERATION! - MJ*

The purpose of this guide is to document best practices, tips, and tricks for
Python hackers.

## Package management and virtual environments
### Anaconda
Prefer for handling packages and environments. More capable than pip + virtualenv. 

Can use `conda` with `pip` if a package is not on the main channel, but check
[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge) as well, many packages have been
migrated by the community.

### pyenv

### pipenv
The new kid on the block. [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) on GitHub.

## IDE's and editors
### Jupyter Lab

### Atom

### Spyder

### Eclipse

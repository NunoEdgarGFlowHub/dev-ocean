This page describes the boards in use regarding the core Ocean Network definition and development. Other complementary projects (for example, those developed by third party companies) could have their own boards to manage the delivery.

# Github Ocean Boards

![Github Ocean Boards](../img/github-boards.png)

Reading the above from top to bottom, the development and definition of Ocean will use different boards or views. Each of these boards have a different meaning:

## Business Board

The [Business Board](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/projects/1) includes the core Ocean Network Roadmap from a high-level point of view.
It can be used to get a better understanding about the next steps and high-level features to be implemented.

The main users of this board are:

* Any Ocean or community member that needs to understand what is included in each Ocean release, and what is the high-level state of the implementation.
* Any Ocean or community member requesting a new Ocean Network feature.


This board is maintained by the Ocean Product team. They are in charge of populating the scope of the Ocean Network, as well as prioritizing and organizing tasks by milestones.

Some relevant information contained in the **Business Board** includes:

* [Ocean Protocol milestones](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open):
  - [Plankton Alpha version (v0.1)](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/milestone/1)
  - [Trilobite Beta version (v0.9)](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/milestone/2)
  - [Tethys RC (v1.0-rc1)](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/milestone/3)
  - [Tethys release (v1.0)](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/milestone/4)
* Business Issues/[Epic stories](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+project%3Aoceanprotocol%2Focean%2F1)
* Categories/[Labels](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/labels)


This board should work as a public interface with the community, showing the relevant, up-to-date Roadmap we are implementing.


## Development Board

The [Development Board](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/projects/2) details the technical tasks we are working on to implement the Ocean Network.
It can be used to get a better understanding of the state of implementation across different issues. It can include new features, bugs, etc.

The main users of this board are:

* The Ocean development team, using this on a daily basis during the delivery process. It should help track the state of the implementations.
* Any community member requesting a new technical improvement or raising a bug.
* Any community member that needs to understand some low level technical details about the Ocean implementation.

This board is maintained by the [Ocean Development team](https://github.com/orgs/oceanprotocol/teams/ocean-development).


Some relevant information contained in the **Development Board** includes:

* [Ocean Protocol milestones](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open). This board shares the same milestones as the **Business Board**. It helps to relate the business requirements to the technical issues.
* [Technical Issues](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+project%3Aoceanprotocol%2Focean%2F1) (Requirements or Bugs)
* [Labels](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/labels) (Same as the **Business Board**.)


![Milestones](../img/board-milestones.png)


This board should work as a public interface with the Open Source community, including developers and early adopters. It should help depict the current state of the implementation details for any Ocean requirement or bug.


## Research Board

The [Research Board](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/projects/3) details the technical investigation we are doing to analyze the open questions we have.
It can be used to get a better understanding of the Ocean's research process and the Proof of Concepts (PoC) we have in progress.

The main users of this board are:

* The Research team, using this on a daily basis during the research process. It should help track the current state of investigations and PoC's.
* The Ocean development team, helping them track the state of the PoC's.
* Any community member that needs to understand what we envision for the state of the art. 


## Engineering Board

The [Engineering Board](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/engineering/projects/1) includes details about the next steps of the [Ocean Engineering Practice](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/engineering/).

The main objective of the Ocean Engineering practice is to:

* Simplify what we do...we should avoid reinventing the wheel.
* Introduce the DevOps practice (CI + CD)
* Promote quality and security.
* Communicate better on what we do and why we are doing it. Our community needs information!
* Be more effective and make a better use of our time.
* Use some common good principles & patterns. Some of these can be useful...

The Engineer Board represents where we are in introducing these best practices.

The main users of this board are the Ocean Development team. This board includes next steps and information about:

* Source Control Management
* Coding Style Guides
* DevOps
* Testing
* etc.

This board is owned by the [Ocean Development team](https://github.com/orgs/oceanprotocol/teams/ocean-development). This team can raise new best practices, technologies, etc., for inclusion as part of the Ocean Engineering practice.

# Squid API

The Squid API is a Level-2 API built on top of core Ocean components. It's a facilitator or enabler, but it's not the only way to interact with Ocean.

**Note 1: "Provider" was renamed to Aquarius and some of its functionality was moved over to Brizo. This page hasn't been updated to reflect that change yet.**

**Note 2: This document was created to help the developers of squid-js, squid-py and squid-java develop a consistent API, but it hasn't kept up with those implementations. For the latest actually-implemented APIs, refer to their repos:**

- [squid-js](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/squid-js)
- [squid-py](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/squid-py)
- [squid-java](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/squid-java)

The goal of this doc is to help a developer develop a version of the Squid API in any programming language. Currently, the Squid API is defined for Object-Oriented languages such as JavaScript, Java, and Python (which are the three initial implementation languages).

### Getting an instance

```java
getInstance(web3Dto, providerDto)
```

#### Parameters

* `web3Dto` - Web3 client wrapped in a DTO object to avoid coupling with specific web3 specific libraries
* `providerDto` - Ocean Provider client wrapped in a DTO object

This method returns an instance of the **Ocean** class. It allows to get access to the other Ocean core methods.

### Instantiate an Ocean object

In Python:

```python
ocean = Ocean('config.ini')


```

In JavaScript:

```js
import { Ocean } from '@oceanprotocol/squid'

const ocean = await Ocean.getInstance({...})
```

## Ocean

This class serves as the interface with Ocean Protocol. The Ocean class aggregates the list of **Account**s 
(ethereum accounts), list of **Asset**s, and a list of **Order** objects. The Ocean class aggregates the 
Keeper class, which in turn interfaces with the running Smart Contracts: Token, ServiceAgreements, PaymentConditions, etc.

Account/wallet:
* Javascript: relies on Metamask wallet/account management. Transactions will prompt the user for approval
* Python: `Ocean` has a main account which defaults to the first account in web3.eth.accounts. The main account can be set 
using `ocean.set_main_account(address, password)`. If the password is not set or invalid, all keeper (on-chain) transactions 
will fail unless the account is unlocked which is not recommended
* Java: TBD

### getAccounts

ASYNC. Returns all available accounts loaded via a wallet, or by Web3.

```js
array[Account] = ocean.getAccounts()
```

### searchAssets

        "page": 0,
        "query": {
          "value": 1
        },
        "sort": {
          "value": 1
        }
}
 ```

### searchAssetsByText

```
array[Asset] = ocean.searchAssetsByText(searchQuery)
```

```

## SecretStore (Private)

Interface provides access to SecretStore functions

### encryptDocument

SYNC. **Private function** encapsulated as part of the `register` function.

It integrates the Parity Ethereum & Secret Store API allowing to encrypt a document.

Given by a **Publisher** an unique resource id (DID), the document to encrypt and the Secret Store cluster threshold (could be pre-defined to a fixed number), integrate the Secret Store APIs to encrypt the document.

```js
encryptedDocument= secretStore.encryptDocument(did, document, threshold)
```

### decryptDocument

SYNC.  **Private function** encapsulated as part of the `getAssetAccess` function. 

It integrates the Parity Ethereum & Secret Store API allowing to decrypt a document if the user executing this function is authorized by a Smart Contract.
Given by a **Consumer** an unique resource id (DID) and the document encrypted, this functions integrates the Secret Store API's to decrypt the document. The on-chain authorization phase is transparent for the user.

```js
document= secretStore.decryptDocument(did, encryptedDocument)
```

## Ocean Boards

In Ocean we use different Github boards to track different parts of the delivery process.

The main [Ocean Boards](alm/boards.md) in use are:

* [Business Board](#business-board)
* [Development Board](#development-board)
* [Engineering Board](#engineering-board)

## Definition of Done (DoD)

A **Definition of Done (DoD)** is a common agreement of the team, defining what should happen to asses an issue has been completed.

The [Ocean Definition of Done](alm/definition-of-done.md) includes a common understanding about what we consider as Done or Completed from a development perspective.
